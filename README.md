# Sugar Free Crypto - A risk free cryptocurrency experience

Welcome to the README for my application. Below is the basic constructs of my client side capstone project while at Nashville Software School.

## Description

Bitcoin was created by the presumed pseudonymous name Satoshi Nakamto in 2009. Since then, Cryptocurrency has witnessed adoption rates as fast as when the internet was first introduced in the 1990s. Currently, venturing into Cryptocurrencies for the first time can be daunting and provide a user an overwhelming experience. Many web pages overload a new user, from needing to provide personal information, as well as bank information. However, Sugar Free Crypto solves this by taking out all the bad stuff and providing a user with a sugar free, healthy experience. Sugar Free Crypto only asks users for an email so each individual has a personalized experience. Additionally, all cryptocurrency interactions are simulated so there is no need for Know Your Customer (KYC), but still providing the user with live price updates each minute!
